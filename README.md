# irAuthor Extensions
A collection of unsupported irAuthor extensions. Most are "user" extensions (as opposed to "system" extensions) and thus must be enabled before they can be used for the first time. You can find the Extensions dialog off of the File menu.

All extension projects reference the InRule SDK in `%programfiles%\InRule`, so it should simply be a matter of downloading and compiling.
