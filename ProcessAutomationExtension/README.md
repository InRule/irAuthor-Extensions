# Introduction
The integration between Process Automation and the InRule Decision Platform provides seamless communication between decisions and processes. You can use the Execute Decision business component within Process Automation to call out to a decision written in irAuthor, or alternatively, you can use the Execute Process action in irAuthor to call out to Process Automation and execute a process from rules.
