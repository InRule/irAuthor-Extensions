# Introduction
The integration between Barium Live and the InRule Decision Platform provides seamless communication between decisions and processes. You can use the Execute Decision business component within Barium Live to call out to a decision written in irAuthor, or alternatively, you can use the Execute Process action in irAuthor to call out to Barium Live and execute a process from rules.
